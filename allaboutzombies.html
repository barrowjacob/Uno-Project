<h1 id="header">All About Zombies</h1>

<p id="zombieIpsum">A zombie (Haitian French: zombi, Haitian Creole: zonbi) is a fictional undead being created through
    the reanimation of a corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from
    Haitian folklore, in which a zombie is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic. Modern
    depictions of the reanimation of the dead do not necessarily involve magic but often invoke science fictional
    methods such as carriers, radiation, mental diseases, vectors, pathogens, parasites, scientific accidents, etc</p>

    <h3 class="codeup">Generic Zombies</h3>
    <div id="zom1"><p>The Generic Zombie, is a person who has been killed and reanimated by a pathogen, often, but not
        always due to a virus. They are usually aggressive. They can be curious, but disorientated, and at a loss to
        fully understand their environment.</p></div>
    <h3 class="codeup">Romero Zombies</h3>
    <div id="zom2"><p>Romero Zombies are the zombies featured in the films of George A. Romero. Romero's vision
        pioneered modern understanding of a Zombie, and walks hand in hand with a Generic Zombie. Additionally, his
        works not only catapulted the concept of 'zombies' into modern consciousness but also defined the term as we use
        it today. These Zombies are slow, unintelligent, react to light and sound, harbor an insatiable hunger for
        living
        flesh, and are killed by having their brain destroyed.</p></div>
    <h3 class="codeup">Zombies of Scientific Origin</h3>
    <div id="zom3"><p>Zombies of Science are reanimated through a means that can be partially (or superficially)
        explained by an existing scientific concept. Most frequently, this is by way of a virus. They are the most
        common types of zombies, featured in many games, movies and novels, such as Max Brooks Zombies and Resident
        Evil.</p></div>
    <h3 class="codeup">Bonies</h3>
    <div id="zom4"><p>Bonies are what a zombie becomes when most of the flesh has rotted from the initial corpse,
        leaving only heavily blackened, necrotic skin and limited tendons. They are the final stage of zombification and
        often do absolutely nothing unless a human or zombie gains their attention through interaction.</p></div>
